  Leap added 2 missing atoms according to residue templates:
       2 H / lone pairs
  The file contained 2 atoms not in residue templates
  Since added/missing = extra, there is a high probability

  total atoms in file: 3997
  Leap added 2 missing atoms according to residue templates:
       2 H / lone pairs
  The file contained 2 atoms not in residue templates
  Since added/missing = extra, there is a high probability
  of atoms with 'incorrect' names; you may want to
  use addPdbAtomMap to map these names, or change in file
